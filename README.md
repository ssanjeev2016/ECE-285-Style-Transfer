# ECE 285 Style Transfer
Description:

This is Project B: Style Transfer developed by Team Deep Learning Hackers with members Sanjeev Sinha, Yue Yang, Jeffrey Alido, and James Salem. We implemented two methods of style transfer, one from Leon Gatys and the other from Justin Johnson. In this repository, we have working demos of both style transfer methods, as well as all the trained models we used for the image transformation network used in the real-time (Johnson) method. We also worked with different types of CNNs when comparing the type of image transformation networks being used in the real-time method and observed whether the style transfer was better or worse than using Johnson's network.
